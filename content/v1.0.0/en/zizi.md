Last Updated: February 4, 2026

This Privacy Policy aims to explain how TwinType Foundry LLC (hereinafter referred to as "the Company") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the ZiZi application and related services. We understand the importance of privacy to you and are committed to ensuring that your personal data is properly protected.

## I. Interpretation and Definitions

*   **Account**: Refers to a unique account created for you to access our Service or parts of our Service.
*   **Application (App)**: Refers to the software program named ZiZi.

*   **Personal Data**: Refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
*   **Usage Data**: Refers to technical information generated automatically by the Service infrastructure.

## II. Cloud Data Processing and Server Logs

To provide stable and high-quality dynamic font services, ZiZi adopts an advanced cloud architecture:

1.  **Font Service**: Parts of the fonts for this Service are stored in the cloud. When you operate through the Application, the system will return relevant data from the server based on demand.
2.  **Server Logs**: When you visit the Service, the server automatically records technical information (such as IP address, access time, requested resources). The Company will not use these logs to conduct behavioral analysis on "individual" users.
3.  **Storage, Deployment, and Acceleration**:
    *   **Infrastructure**: We use internationally renowned cloud platforms and hosting services, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), for program execution and data storage.
    *   **Data Centers**: The main data center is located in Taipei, while some backup information may be located in nodes in Singapore or Japan, or accelerated through global CDN nodes.
4.  **Third-Party Technical Services**: To maintain service stability and optimize experience, we may integrate other third-party analytics (such as Microsoft Clarity) or infrastructure services. The Company promises to collaborate only within the necessary scope and requires them to maintain information security standards.

## III. Types of Data Collected and Purposes

1.  **Personal Data**: Includes email addresses (if logging in via Google/GitHub) and necessary information associated with the account.
2.  **Usage Data**: Includes diagnostic data such as device type, operating system version, and unique device identifiers.
3.  **Camera and Photos**: With your prior authorization, we may access the camera or photo album to implement specific features.
4.  **De-identified Use**: The aforementioned information is used to improve quality only after being de-identified (anonymized). The Company will absolutely not sell your personal information, nor will it send promotional documents without consent.

## IV. Use of Cookies

This Service may write and read Cookies on your device for traffic analysis and behavioral research, without identifying "individual" users. You can configure your settings to refuse Cookies, but this may result in some features being unable to function.

## V. Disclosure of Your Personal Data

The Company will not proactively provide, exchange, or sell your personal data to third parties, unless:

1.  **Legal Requirements and Judicial Authorities**: Cooperation will only be provided within the necessary scope when judicial units of the Republic of China or the United States present a search warrant signed by a judge, or when cooperating with competent authorities conducting lawful investigations pursuant to their official powers.
2.  **Security Maintenance**: Necessary for identifying, contacting, or taking legal action (such as when the Company's rights and interests are damaged).
3.  **Outsourcing Supervision**: If third-party platforms are entrusted to assist in data processing, we will fulfill our supervisory responsibilities to ensure they comply with information security regulations and do not misappropriate data.

## VI. Data Security and Rights

*   **Information Security**: We use commercially acceptable means (such as AWS firewalls and encryption technology) to protect your data, but transmission over the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% absolutely secure.
*   **Your Rights**: You can inquire about, review, supplement, or correct your personal data at any time. If you need to stop collection, processing, or use, please contact us via the customer service email.

## VII. Children's Privacy

## X. Other FAQ

<dl class="faq-list">
  <dt>Will the fonts I load myself be uploaded?</dt>
  <dd>No, the fonts you load yourself will only be saved on your device.</dd>

  <dt>Why do some fonts load slowly?</dt>
  <dd>Cloud fonts are stored on servers. When you select one, it only returns the characters needed for the text you entered, which saves storage space on your phone! Because they are transmitted remotely, there may be a latency of about 300 milliseconds.</dd>

  <dt>What permissions does this app require?</dt>
  <dd>Under normal circumstances, only network and clipboard access are required. This is to fetch remote fonts and copy images. Additionally, when you manually load fonts, the app will read the font file, but it will not be uploaded, and you can delete it at any time!</dd>
